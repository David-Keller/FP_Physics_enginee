THis physics engine is testing the idea of using fixed point math (instead of floats) as a basis for a physics 
system. It uses a 64 bit integer to store the fixed numbers.

The fixed point math can perform +, -, *, /, sin, cos, sqrt.

Bugs and Flaws:
1) grazing collisions cause the objects to orbit (still working on possible solutions)
2) C# was the wrong language to use (was used because of familiarity with unity)
3) sin, cos, sqrt are all very slow and need better algorithms implemented (fast enough for proof of concept)

future plans: 
1) add in rotations and finish up the obb class.
2) rewrite the engine in c++
3) offload the computations onto the GPU using compute shaders
